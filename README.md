# üèè Real-Time Cricket Scorecard Simulator

This web application simulates a short, 3-over cricket match in real-time. It features a modern, decoupled architecture where the match logic is handled by a serverless backend, and the score is updated live on the frontend without needing to refresh the page.

**Live Demo:** https://real-time-cricketscore.netlify.app/

---

## üåü Features
- **Live Score Updates:** The scorecard automatically updates as the match progresses on the backend, powered by real-time database listeners.  
- **Backend-Driven Simulation:** The entire match logic runs on a serverless function, ensuring the simulation continues even if the user closes the browser.  
- **Component-Based UI:** The user interface is built with React and TypeScript, with a clean separation of concerns.  
- **Serverless Architecture:** The project uses a modern Jamstack approach with Netlify Functions for backend logic and Google Firebase for the database, ensuring scalability and a generous free tier.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
This project uses a hybrid cloud architecture, leveraging the strengths of two different platforms:

- **Frontend (React + Vite):** The user interface is a modern React application built with TypeScript and Vite for a fast development experience. It is hosted on Netlify.  
- **Backend Logic (Serverless Function):** The match simulation is a long-running background function written in TypeScript and hosted on Netlify Functions.  
- **Database (Firestore):** The single source of truth for the match state is a Google Firebase Firestore document.  

### ‚ö° Flow
1. The user clicks the **"Start Match"** button in the React UI.  
2. The React app sends a request to the Netlify Background Function.  
3. The Netlify function runs the ~36 second simulation, updating the Firestore document after each ball.  
4. The React app has a live listener attached to the Firestore document, and the UI re-renders automatically with every change.

# üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-repository-folder]

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

bash
npm install

---

## 3. Set Up Firebase

1. Create a project on the Firebase Console.  
2. Create a Firestore Database in your project. Start in test mode for development.  
3. Create a matches collection and add a single document with a randomly generated ID.  
   - Populate the fields (batsmen, bowlers, score, live, status) according to the structure defined in src/types/index.ts.  
4. Generate a Service Account Key:  
   - In your Firebase project, go to Project Settings ‚Üí Service accounts.  
   - Click "Generate new private key". A JSON file will be downloaded.  

---

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

In the root of the project, create a file named `.env` and add: env

# For the frontend (Vite)
VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"

VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"

VITE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID" 

VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"

VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID" 

VITE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID" 

VITE_MATCH_ID="YOUR_FIRESTORE_DOCUMENT_ID" 

# For the backend (Netlify Function)
# Paste the entire content of your downloaded service account JSON file inside the quotes.
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="{...}"

---

## 5. Running Locally

This project uses the Netlify CLI to simulate the cloud environment locally.

### Install the Netlify CLI

bash
npm install netlify-cli --save-dev

### Start Development Server

bash
npx netlify dev

This will start:  
- the Vite server for the frontend  
- and a local server for your startMatch-background.ts function.
